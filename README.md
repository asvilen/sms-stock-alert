## Overview

Stock Alert via SMS is a Python project that helps you stay updated with stock price changes and related news. It monitors the stock price of a specific company and sends you SMS alerts when significant price changes occur. You'll receive the top three news articles related to the company along with the stock price change percentage.

## How It Works

- **Main Script (main.py)**:
  - Imports functions from other modules.
  - Defines the stock name and company name (e.g., TSLA for Tesla Inc).
  - Fetches stock price data using the `get_stock_data` function.
  - Calculates the percentage price difference with `calculate_prc_price_difference`.
  - If the price change is significant (greater than 5% or less than -5%), it fetches the top three news articles using the `get_top_three_articles_list` function and sends SMS alerts with Twilio.

- **News Articles Module (news_articles.py)**:
  - Uses a news API to fetch news articles related to the specified company.
  - Extracts the top three articles and returns them as a list.

- **Stock Prices Module (stock_prices.py)**:
  - Uses an API to retrieve daily stock price data for the specified company.
  - Calculates the percentage price difference between the latest two days.

- **Twilio API Module (twilio_api.py)**:
  - Utilizes Twilio to send SMS alerts.
  - Requires Twilio account credentials, including Account SID and Auth Token, which should be set as environment variables.
