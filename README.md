# SMS Stock Alert

## Overview

Stock Alert via SMS is a Python project that helps you stay updated with stock price changes and related news. It monitors the stock price of a specific company and sends you SMS alerts when significant price changes occur. You'll receive the top three news articles related to the company along with the stock price change percentage.

## How It Works

- **Main Script (main.py)**:
  - Imports functions from other modules.
  - Defines the stock name and company name (e.g., TSLA for Tesla Inc).
  - Fetches stock price data using the `get_stock_data` function.
  - Calculates the percentage price difference with `calculate_prc_price_difference`.
  - If the price change is significant (greater than 5% or less than -5%), it fetches the top three news articles using the `get_top_three_articles_list` function and sends SMS alerts with Twilio.

- **News Articles Module (news_articles.py)**:
  - Uses a news API to fetch news articles related to the specified company.
  - Extracts the top three articles and returns them as a list.

- **Stock Prices Module (stock_prices.py)**:
  - Uses an API to retrieve daily stock price data for the specified company.
  - Calculates the percentage price difference between the latest two days.

- **Twilio API Module (twilio_api.py)**:
  - Utilizes Twilio to send SMS alerts.
  - Requires Twilio account credentials, including Account SID and Auth Token, which should be set as environment variables.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-alert-via-sms.git
  ```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages using pip:
  ```sh
  pip install requests twilio
  ```
3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
- Create an account on [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/).
- Obtain the API keys for Twilio.
- Set the following environment variables in your system or a `.env` file:
  ```sh
  TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
  TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
  ```
  ## Usage

- **Manual Run**: To run the program manually, navigate to the project directory and execute:
  ```sh
  python main.py
  ```
- **Automated Scheduling**: For automated daily execution, consider using a scheduler like cron.
