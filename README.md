## How It Works

- **Main Script (main.py)**:
  - The heart of the operation!
  - Imports functions from other modules.
  - Defines the stock name and company name (e.g., TSLA for [Tesla Inc](https://www.tesla.com/)).
  - Fetches stock price data using the `get_stock_data` function.
  - Calculates the percentage price difference with `calculate_prc_price_difference`.
  - If the price change is noteworthy (greater than 5% or less than -5%), it fetches the top three news articles using the `get_top_three_articles_list` function and sends SMS alerts via [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/).

- **News Articles Module (news_articles.py)**:
  - Leverages the power of news APIs.
  - Fetches fresh news articles related to the specified company.
  - Selects the top three articles and serves them to you.
  - News API Endpoint: [https://newsapi.org/v2/everything](https://newsapi.org/v2/everything)

- **Stock Prices Module (stock_prices.py)**:
  - Connects to the [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/).
  - Retrieves daily stock price data for the chosen company.
  - Computes the percentage price difference between the latest two days.

- **Twilio API Module (twilio_api.py)**:
  - Employs the magic of [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) for SMS alerts.
  - Requires your Twilio account credentials, including Account SID and Auth Token, set as environment variables.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

To embark on this journey, start by cloning this repository to your local machine:


  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sms-stock-alert.git
  ```
### Install Dependencies

Prepare your toolkit by installing the required Python packages using pip:
  ```sh
  pip install requests twilio
  ```
### Set Up Environment Variables

To set up the required environment variables:

1. **News API (For News Articles)**:
   - Create an account on [News API ORG](https://newsapi.org/).
   - Obtain the API key.
   - Set the following environment variable in your system or a `.env` file:

     ```
     NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key
     ```

2. **Alpha Vantage API (For Stock Prices)**:
   - Register at [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/).
   - Acquire the API key.
   - Set the following environment variable in your system or a `.env` file:

     ```
     STOCK_API_KEY=your_alpha_vantage_api_key
     ```

3. **Twilio API (For SMS Alerts)**:
   - Create an account on [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/).
   - Obtain your Twilio Account SID, Auth Token, and a Twilio phone number.
   - Set the following environment variables in your system or a `.env` file:

     ```
     TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
     TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
     ```

Replace `your_news_api_key`, `your_alpha_vantage_api_key`, `your_twilio_account_sid`, and `your_twilio_auth_token` with the actual keys and credentials.

## Usage

### Manual Run

To run the program manually, navigate to the project directory and execute:
  ```sh
  python main.py
  ```
### Automated Scheduling

For a seamless journey, consider automating daily execution using a scheduler like cron.
